# 🧪 Real-Time Team Collaboration - Testing Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

All features have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ Backend team management API
- ✅ Socket.IO real-time server
- ✅ Frontend team management UI
- ✅ Kanban board with real-time sync
- ✅ Team selector and active users display

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Start Both Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```powershell
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Wait for:
- `🚀 Server is running on port 5000`
- `🍃 MongoDB Connected`
- `🔌 Socket.IO: Enabled for real-time sync`

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```powershell
npm run dev
```
Wait for:
- `VITE v7.1.7  ready`
- `➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/`

### Step 2: Setup Team (Browser 1)

1. **Login** at http://localhost:5173
   - Use: `admin@hackathon.com` / `admin123`
   - Or any registered account

2. **Create a Team**
   - Click **"Teams"** button in header
   - Click **"Create Team"**
   - Name: "Test Hackathon Team"
   - Description: "Testing real-time sync"
   - Click **"Create Team"**

3. **Copy Invite Code**
   - You'll see your new team card
   - Copy the invite code (e.g., "AB12CD34")
   - Keep this browser open!

### Step 3: Join Team (Browser 2)

1. **Open Incognito/Private Window**
   - Firefox: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Chrome: `Ctrl+Shift+N`
   - Edge: `Ctrl+Shift+N`

2. **Navigate** to http://localhost:5173

3. **Login with Different Account**
   - Create new account or use: `user@example.com` / `password123`
   
4. **Join the Team**
   - Click **"Teams"** button
   - Click **"Join Team"**
   - Enter the invite code from Browser 1
   - Click **"Join Team"**
   - You should see success message!

### Step 4: Test Real-Time Sync

#### Browser 1:
1. Click back to **Kanban Board** (home icon or navigate away from Teams)
2. You should see the team selector at the top
3. Your team should be selected automatically
4. Notice: "2 members" and "1 online" (or 2 if timing is perfect)

#### Browser 2:
1. Navigate to **Kanban Board**
2. Select your team from dropdown if needed
3. Watch the "online" counter - should show 2 users!

#### Real-Time Test Actions:

**In Browser 1:**
1. **Create a task:**
   - Click "Add Task" on any column
   - Title: "Test Task from User 1"
   - Description: "Testing real-time sync"
   - Priority: High
   - Click "Create Task"

**In Browser 2:**
- ✅ Task should appear **INSTANTLY** without refresh!
- ✅ Check the console: Should see "📋 Remote columns update received"

**In Browser 2:**
1. **Move the task:**
   - Drag the task to a different column (e.g., Pending → In Progress)

**In Browser 1:**
- ✅ Task should move **INSTANTLY** without refresh!
- ✅ Check the console: Should see "📋 Remote columns update received"

**In Both Browsers:**
1. **Create more tasks** from each browser
2. **Drag and drop** tasks between columns
3. **Watch the magic** - all changes sync in real-time! ✨

### Step 5: Test User Presence

1. **In Browser 1:** Note the "online" indicator (should show 2)
2. **Close Browser 2**
3. **In Browser 1:** Wait a few seconds
   - Online count should drop (may need to refresh)
4. **Reopen Browser 2** and login
   - Online count should increase again

### Step 6: Test with 3+ Users (Optional)

1. Open a **third browser** (e.g., different browser entirely)
2. Login with another account
3. Join the same team using invite code
4. All three browsers should now sync!

## 🔍 What to Verify

### ✅ Team Management
- [x] Can create team
- [x] Can join team with invite code
- [x] Can see team members
- [x] Can copy invite code
- [x] Owner can regenerate invite code
- [x] Owner can remove members
- [x] Members can leave team
- [x] Owner can delete team

### ✅ Real-Time Sync
- [x] Tasks appear instantly in all browsers
- [x] Task moves sync instantly
- [x] Column updates broadcast to all members
- [x] Active users counter updates
- [x] Console logs show Socket.IO events

### ✅ User Experience
- [x] Team selector shows all teams
- [x] Selected team displays member count

## 🎯 Expected Console Output

### Browser 1 (when creating task):
```
📋 Remote columns update received: {...}
```

### Browser 2 (when Browser 1 creates task):
```
🔌 Connected to Socket.IO server
👥 User Test User joined team abc123
📋 Remote columns update received: {columns: [...], timestamp: "..."}
```

### Backend Server:
```
🔌 User connected: socketId123
👥 User Test User joined team abc123
📝 Columns updated in team abc123
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tasks don't sync
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for Socket.IO connection errors
2. Verify both users are in the same team
3. Check backend logs for Socket.IO events
4. Refresh both browsers and rejoin team

### Issue: "Cannot read property '_id' of null"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you created/joined a team first
2. Select team from dropdown before using Kanban board

### Issue: Socket.IO connection failed
**Solution:**
1. Verify backend is running on port 5000
2. Check CORS configuration in backend
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: Invite code doesn't work
**Solution:**
1. Verify code is exactly 8 characters
2. Try regenerating the code (owner only)
3. Check backend logs for errors

## 📊 Performance Metrics

**Expected Performance:**
- Task creation: < 100ms
- Real-time sync: < 50ms
- Socket.IO latency: < 20ms
- UI responsiveness: 60fps

5. Should reconnect automatically

### Scenario 3: Concurrent Edits
1. Browser 1: Start dragging a task
2. Browser 2: Drag same task simultaneously
3. Last action should win

### Scenario 4: Multiple Teams
1. Create 2 different teams
2. Join both with same user
3. Switch between teams
4. Verify tasks are isolated per team
