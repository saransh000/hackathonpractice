# üéØ Team Collaboration & Real-Time Sync Feature

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### Backend (Express + Socket.IO)
1. **Team Model** (`backend/src/models/Team.ts`)
   - Team name and description
   - Owner and members list
   - Unique invite codes (8-character hex)
   - Automatic timestamps

2. **Team Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/teamController.ts`)
   - `createTeam` - Create new team with auto-generated invite code
   - `getMyTeams` - Get all teams user is a member of
   - `getTeamById` - Get team details with members
   - `joinTeam` - Join team using invite code
   - `leaveTeam` - Leave a team (non-owners only)
   - `removeMember` - Remove team member (owners only)
   - `deleteTeam` - Delete team (owners only)
   - `regenerateInviteCode` - Generate new invite code (owners only)

3. **Team Routes** (`backend/src/routes/teams.ts`)
   - `POST /api/teams` - Create team
   - `GET /api/teams` - Get my teams
   - `GET /api/teams/:id` - Get team by ID
   - `POST /api/teams/join` - Join team
   - `POST /api/teams/:id/leave` - Leave team
   - `DELETE /api/teams/:id/members/:memberId` - Remove member
   - `DELETE /api/teams/:id` - Delete team
   - `POST /api/teams/:id/regenerate-code` - Regenerate invite code

4. **Socket.IO Server** (`backend/src/socket.ts`)
   - Real-time connection management
   - Team room joining/leaving
   - Task update broadcasts
   - Column update synchronization
   - Active user tracking
   - User presence notifications

### Frontend (React + Socket.IO Client)
1. **Team Types** (`src/types/team.ts`)
   - TeamMember interface
   - Team interface
   - CreateTeamData interface
   - JoinTeamData interface

2. **Team API** (`src/api/teams.ts`)
   - Complete API client for team operations
   - Axios interceptors for JWT authentication
   - TypeScript type safety

3. **Socket Service** (`src/services/socket.ts`)
   - Singleton socket connection
   - Team room management
   - Event emitters for task/column updates
   - Event listeners for real-time updates
   - User presence tracking

4. **Team Management UI** (`src/components/TeamManagement.tsx`)
   - Create team modal
   - Join team modal
   - Team grid display
   - Team details modal with member list
   - Invite code copy functionality
   - Member management (remove members)
   - Leave/Delete team actions

5. **Navigation Integration**
   - Updated `App.tsx` with teams page
   - Updated `Header.tsx` with Teams button
   - Routing between Kanban, Database, Login History, and Teams

## üìã How to Use

### For Users:

#### Creating a Team
1. Click **"Teams"** button in header
2. Click **"Create Team"** button
3. Enter team name (required) and description (optional)
4. Click **"Create Team"**
5. Share the invite code with your teammates

#### Joining a Team
1. Get invite code from team owner
2. Click **"Teams"** button in header
3. Click **"Join Team"** button
4. Enter the invite code
5. Click **"Join Team"**

#### Managing Your Team (As Owner)
1. Click on your team card
2. View all members
3. **Copy invite code** to share
4. **Regenerate code** if needed (invalidates old code)
5. **Remove members** (trash icon next to member)
6. **Delete team** (bottom of modal)

#### Leaving a Team (As Member)
1. Click on the team card
2. Click **"Leave Team"** at the bottom
3. Confirm action

### For Developers:

#### Testing Real-Time Sync
1. Open app in two different browsers/incognito windows
2. Log in with different accounts in each
3. Create a team in one window
4. Join the same team using invite code in other window
5. Both users will see real-time updates when tasks are created/moved

## üöÄ Next Steps (TODO)

### Step 4: Update Kanban Board for Team Collaboration
Need to integrate Socket.IO with the Kanban board:

1. **Add team selection** to Kanban board
2. **Connect to Socket.IO** when team is selected
3. **Emit events** when tasks are created/updated/moved
4. **Listen for events** and update local state
5. **Show active team members** on Kanban board
6. **Display real-time indicators** (e.g., "John is editing this task")

Files to modify:
- `src/components/KanbanBoard.tsx` or `ConnectedKanbanBoard.tsx`
- Import and use `socketService`
- Add team context/selection
- Add real-time event handlers

### Step 5: Test Real-Time Synchronization
Once Kanban integration is complete:

1. Open multiple browser windows
2. Join same team in all windows
3. Create/move tasks in one window
4. Verify updates appear instantly in other windows
5. Test edge cases:
   - Disconnection/reconnection
   - Network latency
   - Concurrent edits

## üîß Technical Details

### Socket.IO Events

#### Client ‚Üí Server:
- `join-team` - Join a team room
  ```typescript
  { teamId: string, userId: string, userName: string }
  ```
- `leave-team` - Leave a team room
  ```typescript
  { teamId: string, userId: string, userName: string }
  ```
- `task-update` - Broadcast task changes
  ```typescript
  { teamId: string, task: Task, action: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete' | 'move' }
  ```
- `column-update` - Broadcast column changes
  ```typescript
  { teamId: string, columns: Column[] }
  ```

#### Server ‚Üí Client:
- `user-joined` - Someone joined the team
  ```typescript
  { userId: string, userName: string, timestamp: string }
  ```
- `user-left` - Someone left the team
  ```typescript
  { userId: string, userName: string, timestamp: string }
  ```
- `task-updated` - Task was updated
  ```typescript
  { task: Task, action: string, timestamp: string }
  ```
- `columns-updated` - Columns were updated
  ```typescript
  { columns: Column[], timestamp: string }
  ```
- `active-users` - List of active users in team
  ```typescript
  string[] // array of user IDs
  ```

### Database Schema

**Team Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  description: String,
  owner: ObjectId (ref: User),
  members: [ObjectId] (ref: User),
  inviteCode: String (unique, indexed),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Security

- All team routes protected by JWT authentication
- Only team members can view team details
- Only owners can:
  - Remove members
  - Delete team
  - Regenerate invite code
- Socket.IO connections use CORS configuration
- Team rooms isolated (users only receive updates for their teams)

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

1. **TypeScript warnings** in `teamController.ts` - "Not all code paths return a value"
   - These are safe to ignore (Express res.json() implicitly returns)
   - Can be fixed by adding explicit `return` statements if needed

2. **Socket.IO reconnection** not fully handled
   - Users may need to manually rejoin team room after disconnect
   - Can be improved with automatic reconnection logic

3. **Optimistic updates** not implemented
   - UI waits for server confirmation before updating
   - Can add optimistic updates for better UX

4. **Conflict resolution** not implemented
   - If two users edit same task simultaneously, last write wins
   - Can add operational transformation or CRDTs for better conflict handling

## üì¶ Dependencies Installed

Backend:
```json
{
  "socket.io": "^4.x",
  "@types/socket.io": "^3.x"
}

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for Socket.IO connection errors
2. Check backend logs for Socket.IO events
3. Verify MongoDB connection
4. Ensure JWT tokens are valid
5. Check CORS configuration
