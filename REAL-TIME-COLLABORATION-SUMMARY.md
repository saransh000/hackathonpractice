## 📝 Test Checklist

### Must Test:
- [ ] Create team with valid data
- [ ] Join team with invite code
- [ ] Select team in Kanban board
- [ ] Create task in Browser 1 → See in Browser 2
- [ ] Move task in Browser 2 → See in Browser 1
- [ ] Active users counter shows correct count
- [ ] Leave team removes access
- [ ] Delete team works (owner only)

### Should Test:
- [ ] Invalid invite code shows error
- [ ] Non-owner can't remove members
- [ ] Regenerate code invalidates old code
- [ ] Multiple teams work independently
- [ ] Socket reconnection after disconnect
- [ ] Performance with many tasks

### Nice to Test:
- [ ] Network latency simulation
- [ ] Concurrent edits behavior
- [ ] Browser compatibility
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Load testing with many users

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **TypeScript Warnings:** 
   - `teamController.ts` has "not all code paths return" warnings
   - These are safe to ignore (Express handlers)

2. **Socket Reconnection:**
   - Manual rejoin needed after disconnect
   - Can be improved with auto-reconnect logic

3. **Optimistic Updates:**
   - UI waits for server confirmation
   - Can add optimistic updates for better UX

4. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - Last write wins for concurrent edits
   - Can implement CRDTs for better handling

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

**Phase 2 (Nice to Have):**
- [ ] Real-time task comments
- [ ] @mentions in comments
- [ ] Task notifications
- [ ] Typing indicators
- [ ] File attachments
- [ ] Task history/activity log
- [ ] Drag & drop task assignment
- [ ] Team chat room

**Phase 3 (Advanced):**

- [ ] Recurring tasks
- [ ] Time tracking
- [ ] Gantt chart view
- [ ] Sprint planning
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
