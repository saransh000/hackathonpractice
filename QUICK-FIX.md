# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Fix Summary

## Problem
"Failed to create task. Please try again." error when creating tasks

## Root Cause
Backend requires `boardId` field, frontend wasn't sending it

## Solution
1. **ConnectedKanbanBoard.tsx**: Added board initialization
   - Gets existing board or creates new one on mount
   - Passes `boardId` to KanbanBoard component

2. **KanbanBoard.tsx**: Updated task creation
   - Accepts `boardId` prop
   - Includes `boardId` and `column` in API request

## Test Now
1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Check console** for: "âœ… Loaded existing board:" or "âœ… Created new board:"
3. **Create a task** - Should work now! âœ¨
4. **Check console** for: "âœ… Task created and synced:"

## Expected Result
âœ… Tasks create successfully  
âœ… No more errors  
âœ… Real-time sync works  

## Files Changed
- `src/components/ConnectedKanbanBoard.tsx` - Board initialization
- `src/components/KanbanBoard.tsx` - Send boardId with tasks

---

**Status**: âœ… FIXED - Test in browser now!
